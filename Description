# AI-Powered Real-Time Webcam Enhancement App

## Overview
This project is an intelligent, real-time webcam enhancement application powered by deep learning. It captures your laptop's webcam feed, analyzes each frame, and automatically applies the best enhancement technique using AIâ€”such as super-resolution, denoising, low-light improvement, or face beautification. The result is a smarter, sharper, and more visually appealing webcam experience for video calls, streaming, or content creation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Processing:** Enhances webcam video instantly with minimal latency.
- **AI-Driven Enhancement Selection:** Uses AI to analyze each frame and dynamically apply the most suitable enhancement (e.g., denoising, sharpening, upscaling, beautification, or low-light correction).
- **Plug-and-Play Deep Learning Models:** Integrates state-of-the-art pre-trained models like Real-ESRGAN (super-resolution), DnCNN (denoising), and others.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Leverages GPU for fast, real-time deep learning inference.
- **User Feedback Loop (Optional):** Allows users to provide feedback, enabling the system to learn and improve enhancement strategies over time.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extendable to add new enhancements or swap models.

## Use Cases

- Improve video quality for online meetings and streaming.
- Enhance clarity and brightness in low-light environments.
- Remove noise and artifacts from webcam feeds.
- Automatically beautify faces for professional or casual video calls.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for main application logic and processing.
- **OpenCV** for video capture and display.
- **PyTorch** (or TensorFlow) for deep learning inference.
- **Pre-trained Deep Learning Models** for image enhancement.
- **CUDA** for GPU acceleration (if available).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (`pip install ...` and model setup).
2. Run the app (`python app.py`).
3. See your webcam feed enhanced in real time by intelligent AI.

## Future Directions

- Add more advanced scene analysis and enhancement selection using custom-trained AI.
- Integrate with virtual webcam drivers to use enhanced video in other applications.
- Support for additional platforms and webcam sources.
